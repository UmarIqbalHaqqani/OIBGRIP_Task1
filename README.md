# OIBGRIP_Task1
I am an Oasis infobyte intern who has finished level 1 of web development and design. Task 1: establish a landing page
A landing page is one of the best web development projects for beginners. This project necessitates a fundamental 
familiarity of HTML and CSS. You will learn how to add columns, separate sections, arrange objects, and add headers 
and footers. Most essential, you will utilise your imagination to make the page look outstanding. Alignments, padding,
colour palette, boxes, and all other elements on the page demand care. CSS should be used with caution to prevent page elements from overlapping.
